Display an icon by name (`iconName`). By default, the icon size and color are inherited from the parent but
can be controlled with the `s` and `color` props.

```jsx
// loadExample('./exampleDefault');
```

We are using [Material Design Iconic Font](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/icons.html); all
available icons are listed there.
