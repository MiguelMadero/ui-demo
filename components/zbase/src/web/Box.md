A generic block-level container similar to HTML's `<div>`. It does not have any semantic meaning on its own.

As with all of components, `Box` accepts common utility props.

```jsx
// loadExample('./Box/exampleDefault')
```

`Box` also supports borders:

```jsx
// loadExample('./Box/exampleBorders')
```
